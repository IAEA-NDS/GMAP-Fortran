## About GMAP

GMAP developed by Wolfgang P. Poenitz is a code to obtain evaluations
of cross sections and their uncertainties based on the combined data
from various experiments. The code employs the Bayesian version
of the Generalized Least Squares method and is named after the
mathematicians Gauss, Markov, and Aitken, who all contributed
to the statistical theory around the linear least squares method.
Input to GMAP are experimental data preprocessed by the [DATP] code,
also developed by Poenitz. 

Notably, these codes have been employed for the evaluation
of [neutron cross section standards]. Among other available documents,
there is a [short user guide] for DATP and GMAP and a more detailed
[report] on the technicalities of the codes.
